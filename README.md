# Alpha Toe (any game, any framework!)

### We took this dudes code and we're gonna make it play tic-tac-toe to prove Gary is wrong about us. 

#### It also gives us a little more time to get shogi working.

To start training a model for Tic Tac Toe :
```bash
python main.py
```
Choose your framework and game in ```main.py```.

### Experiments
We trained a Tensorflow model for 3x3 Tic Toe. You can play a game against it. Probably
