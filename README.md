#### It also gives us a little more time to get shogi working.

To start training a model for Tic Tac Toe :
```bash
python main.py
```
Choose your framework and game in ```main.py```.

### Experiments
We trained a Tensorflow model for 3x3 Tic Toe. You can play a game against it. Probably

### Ya Boiz
The new edited code was written by Shane Caldwell and Noah Johnson.
